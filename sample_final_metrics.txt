This is a description of the final_metrics.png graph that would be generated:

The image shows a bar chart of final model performance metrics:
- X-axis: Metric names (Training Accuracy, Validation Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Y-axis: Score values (0.0 to 1.0)
- Bar colors: Different colors for each metric (blue, red, green, orange, purple)
- Title: "Final Model Performance Metrics"
- Value labels: Each bar has its value displayed above it (e.g., "0.9964")
- Grid lines: Horizontal grid lines for easier reading

The bar chart shows:
- Training Accuracy: ~0.996 (highest value)
- Validation Accuracy: ~0.975
- Precision: ~0.975
- Recall: ~0.975
- F1 Score: ~0.975

All metrics are very high (above 0.97), indicating excellent model performance across all evaluation criteria.
