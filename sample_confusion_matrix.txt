This is a description of the confusion_matrix.png graph that would be generated:

The image shows a normalized confusion matrix:
- X-axis: Predicted labels (Healthy, Frozen Teats, Mastitis, Teat Lesions, Low Udder Score, Medium Udder Score, High Udder Score)
- Y-axis: True labels (same categories)
- Color scale: Blues colormap, with darker blue indicating higher values
- Values: Normalized from 0.0 to 1.0, with most diagonal values above 0.95 (indicating high accuracy)
- Title: "Normalized Confusion Matrix"
- Text annotations: Each cell contains the normalized value (e.g., "0.98")
- Text color: White for dark cells, black for light cells

The confusion matrix shows:
- Strong diagonal values (0.95-1.00) indicating high classification accuracy for all classes
- Minor confusion between similar classes (e.g., between different udder scores)
- Very little confusion between dissimilar conditions (e.g., healthy vs. mastitis)
