This is an AI-powered veterinary diagnostic tool that uses computer vision and machine learning to automatically detect and classify various udder and teat conditions in dairy cattle. The system can identify 7 different conditions:
Healthy udders
Frozen teats (cold damage)
Mastitis (mammary gland inflammation)
Teat lesions (cuts, cracks, warts)
Low/Medium/High udder scores (udder conformation assessment)
Key Features:
Web-based interface built with Streamlit for easy image upload and analysis
Deep learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of cow udder images
Real-time classification with confidence scores and treatment recommendations
Educational component providing detailed information about each condition and its impact
Voice feedback capability for accessibility
The system helps dairy farmers and veterinarians quickly identify udder health issues, enabling early intervention and improved animal welfare while reducing economic losses from undetected conditions.
